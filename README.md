# Informer Based Filtering and Multi-scan Prediction Method for  Maneuvering Radar Target Trajectory

This repository is designed to address the radar maneuvering target tracking problem. The project uses Informer as the baseline to achieve real-time tracking and multi-scan prediction.

And this is the official implementation of article "__Informer-Based Joint Tracking and Trajectory Prediction of Maneuvering Radar Targets__". If you find this work helpful for your research, please cite this paper

## Requirements

* python==3.10
* numpy==2.3.3
* PyYAML==6.0.2
* scipy==1.16.2
* torch==2.0.1

## Usage

* **Data Generation**: The data is generated by MATLAB scripts. Navigate to the `matlab/Data_Generation` folder and run `main_gen_data_offline_train.m` and `main_gen_data_online_track.m` to generate offline training data and online tracking data, respectively. The generated data will be saved in the `data/InforMTP` folder.
* **Network Training and Inference:** Run `main_informer.py` to perform training and inference. The trained model weights will be saved in the `checkpoints` folder, and the inference results will be stored in the `matlab/network_output` folder.
* **Trajectory Recovery and Visualization:** Use the MATLAB script `matlab/Trajectory_Recovery/main_revise_data.m` to recover and visualize the tracking results.

## Parameters

The main parameters are recorded in the `config.yaml` file. Edit it to change the data generation and training parameters.
