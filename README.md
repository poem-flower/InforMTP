##  Enhanced Datasets Based on LAST

The [LAST dataset](https://github.com/ljx43031/DeepMTT-algorithm) is augmented with velocity jumps and stochastic variations in acceleration and motion patterns. Here is part of the dataset.

## Online Tracking and Multi-step Prediction

InforMTP performs online tracking and prediction using a temporal sliding window. At each time step, it outputs a fixed-length sequence of filtered states together with multi-step predictions.

## Requirements

* python==3.10
* numpy==2.3.3
* PyYAML==6.0.2
* scipy==1.16.2
* torch==2.0.1

## Usage Workflow

* **Data Generation**: The data is generated by MATLAB scripts. Navigate to the `matlab/Data_Generation` folder and run `main_gen_data_offline_train.m` and `main_gen_data_online_track.m` to generate offline training data and online tracking data, respectively. The generated data will be saved in the `data/InforMTP` folder.
* **Network Training and Inference:** Run `main_informer.py` to perform training and inference. The trained model weights will be saved in the `checkpoints` folder, and the inference results will be stored in the `matlab/network_output` folder.
* **Trajectory Recovery and Visualization:** Use the MATLAB script `matlab/Trajectory_Recovery/main_revise_data.m` to recover and visualize the tracking results.

## Parameters

The main parameters are recorded in the `config.yaml` file. Edit it to change the data generation and training parameters.
